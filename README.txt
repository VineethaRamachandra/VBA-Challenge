Primarily, there are two parts to this program which are addressed by two for loops

1st part of the program/for loop: This loop iterates through every cell in a given sheet and then loops through different sheets.
Following are different actions:
- Print four new colummn headers viz; "Ticker", "Yearly Change", "Percent Change", "Total Stock Volumen" in every sheet
- Caluclate and display values in all of those four columns in every sheet 
- Conditonal formatting to different positive and negative $age values in the Yearly Change column 


2nd For Loop
To determine max %age, min %age, and max vol of trade.  

Program takes a long time to compile, because of the last for loop. There are no errors. Output is as presented in the different image files  2018.png, 2019.png, 2020.png
